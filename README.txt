1. This code was written in c# and can be opened in visual studio 2005 by using SubstitutionCracker.sln
2. It can be run using the SubstitutionCracker.exe in the bin\Release folder
3. Simply use the "Load Training File" button to load a training file, I included training_text.txt
4. Then use the "Load Plain Text and Encrypt with Random Key" button to load the plain text to decrypt,
   I included test_cipher.txt.
5. The code does not use plain text in the fitness function but just as a hack to stop execution early
   once decryption succeeded. This was used to speed up experimentation process without comprising the
   data.
6. The code is pretty raw and needs documentation and bit of rework, and the user interface is primitive
   and adds several features which were used for data collection and not useful for decrypting.
7. Have fun
